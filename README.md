## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

> **Random Quote:** The fight is won or lost far from witnesses - on the training ground, in the quiet hours, in the discipline no one sees.

I'm Raymond, and I'm building an OS from scratch using **Assembly** and **C**.
Everything I learn - the blood, the sweat, and regrets - gets documented here:

+ [Crafting an OS: Notes & Insights](https://github.com/brogrammer232/Crafting-an-OS-Notes-and-Insights)
+ [Bare-Metal Assembly](https://github.com/brogrammer232/Bare-Metal-Assembly)
+ *(Coming Soon!)* [C Systems Programming](#)

These notes are beginner-friendly, battle-tested, and written with clarity in mind. If you're starting your own OS journey, they'll give you a solid foundation and a clear roadmap. Have fun!

- âš¡ Fun fact: I once spent 3 hours debugging a triple fault, only to realize I forgot to load the IDT. I hate myself.
